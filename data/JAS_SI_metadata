Metadata

Site - an ordinal code for each site so that I could keep them straight in some of my earlier analyses

Site code - 3 letter code for each site

Location - location of turtle capture

LAB ID - self explanatory

Collection Date - self explanatory

Run Date - self explanatory

%N - elemental concentration of N.  that is, how much each sample is made up of nitrogen.  this is used as a diagnostic to know sample quality (anything outside of ~9-17% N raises a red flag)

%C - elemental concentration of C.  that is, how much each sample is made up of carbon.  this is used as a diagnostic to know sample quality (anything outside of ~40-60% C raises a red flag)

d15N - stable isotope value for N

d13C - stable isotope value for C

Color - rarely filled in. This is largely for the Galapagos and Colombia, where black turtles (eastern Pacific stock) and yellow turtles (west pacific origins) co-exist.  Safe to say that anything that is not filled in here would be a ‘black’ morph.

SCL - straight carapace length

CCL - curved carapace length (if a Y is present, that means that we have the data in a different database. But in fact, for both SCL and CCL we likely have these data in other databases for a lot of the turtles.
